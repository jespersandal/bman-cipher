# bman-cipher
A quick webapplication that can be used for manually guessing a short substitution cipher (Caesar cipher).

It could use some additional features:
A field for the user to input a cipher text to break.
Statistics such as frequency of the letters.
A button to reset the puzzle.

Things to improve:
Make it easier to find which letter to edit, if you think you have guessed wrong.
Perhaps show which letters from the alphabet that you have already used.
